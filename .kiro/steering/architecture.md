# Architecture

Build the rewrite as a Vite React TypeScript app with Phaser 3 embedded inside React.

## Toolchain

- **Build:** Vite with `@vitejs/plugin-react`
- **Language:** TypeScript in strict mode
- **UI framework:** React 19
- **Game engine:** Phaser 3 (latest v3.x)
- **Test runner:** Vitest with fast-check for property-based tests
- **Linter:** ESLint with typescript-eslint and react-hooks plugins
- **Package manager:** npm with exact version pinning for core deps

Use one unified Phaser game with shared core systems and mode-specific scenes. Shared systems should handle cross-mode concepts such as:

- game configuration and settings validation
- input mapping
- scoring and match lifecycle
- ball and paddle primitives
- collision helpers
- audio event routing
- powerup registry and effect application
- pause/resume/restart/menu transitions

Mode-specific scenes should handle the rules and layout for each mode:

- `PongScene` for `Pong: Solo` and `Pong: Versus`
- `BreakoutScene` for `Breakout`

Prefer this ownership split:

- React components: menus, settings controls, modal overlays, HUD containers when outside the Phaser canvas, routing between app states.
- Phaser scenes: active gameplay simulation, arcade physics bodies, canvas rendering, gameplay input, particles, tweens, camera effects, and event emission.
- Pure TypeScript modules: deterministic game rules that are practical to test without Phaser.

Keep deterministic gameplay logic outside Phaser scene methods where practical. Good candidates for pure modules include:

- Pong win-score validation
- Pong scoring and serve direction rules
- AI target selection and difficulty configuration
- Breakout brick-grid generation
- Breakout life/win/loss rules
- powerup definitions, eligibility, duration, stacking policy, and effect metadata
- collision math that does not depend on Phaser runtime objects

Phaser scenes may orchestrate runtime details, but they should not become the only place where game rules exist. If a rule can be expressed as data or a pure function, prefer doing that.

Use TypeScript-first boundaries. Define explicit types for:

- game modes
- match settings
- AI difficulty presets
- player identifiers
- powerup IDs and powerup effects
- scene launch payloads
- scene-to-React events
- audio event names

## System Initialization Order

When the game starts (GameView mounts), systems must be initialized in this order:

1. **SceneLauncher** — call `setLaunchPayload(payload)` with the match settings BEFORE creating the Phaser game
2. **AudioManager** — call `audioManager.init()` to create the AudioContext and subscribe to EventBridge audio events
3. **Phaser Game** — create `new Phaser.Game(config)` with the scene added via `postBoot` callback
4. **PongScene/BreakoutScene** — reads payload from SceneLauncher in `init()`, sets up physics and input in `create()`

On cleanup (GameView unmounts):
1. Destroy the Phaser game (`game.destroy(true)`)
2. Destroy the AudioManager (`audioManager.destroy()`)

The AudioManager is a passive EventBridge listener — it does nothing until `init()` is called. Forgetting to call `init()` results in silent audio (no errors, just no sound).

## Communication Patterns

| Direction | Mechanism | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| React → Phaser (launch) | SceneLauncher module variable | Settings, mode, winScore |
| React → Phaser (runtime) | EventBridge events | `match:pause`, `scene:restart` |
| Phaser → React | EventBridge events | `score:update`, `match:win`, `audio:*` |
| React → AudioManager | Direct method calls | `toggleMute()`, `setVolume()` |
| AudioManager → React | EventBridge `audio:state-change` | Mute/volume state updates |
| Scenes → Audio | EventBridge `audio:*` events | Passive — AudioManager listens automatically |

## Critical Implementation Rules (Learned from Bugs)

These rules exist because violating them caused real bugs during implementation:

1. **Never set `body.y` directly on a moving physics body.** Let Phaser move it via velocity, then clamp only at boundaries.
2. **Always reposition the ball to center immediately when a point is scored.** Don't leave it out of bounds during a serve delay.
3. **Use `window` event listeners for keyboard input** (not Phaser's keyboard plugin) when the game is embedded in React. Phaser's default targets the canvas which loses focus to React elements.
4. **Always call `audioManager.init()` before gameplay starts.** It's a passive listener that does nothing until initialized.
5. **Use the SceneLauncher pattern for passing data to scenes.** Don't rely on Phaser's `scene.add` data parameter timing.
6. **Add a visible serve delay (500ms–1s)** before the first serve and between points so players can see the ball reset.
7. **Only ONE component should own the Escape key handler.** GameView handles both pause and unpause via its single `document` keydown listener. Overlays must NOT register their own Escape handlers — this causes race conditions where pause is immediately undone on the same keypress.
8. **Do NOT use `this.physics.pause()` or `this.scene.pause()` for pausing.** When scenes are added dynamically via `postBoot`, these Phaser system references may be null. Instead, use a manual approach: set `this.paused = true` (gates the update loop), save the ball's velocity, set ball velocity to 0, and also zero all paddle velocities (including AI). On resume, restore the saved velocity. If the saved velocity was {0,0} (paused before serve), schedule a new serve after a short delay.
9. **When pausing, zero ALL body velocities — not just the ball.** AI paddle velocity persists between frames even when `update()` stops running. Explicitly set paddle velocities to 0 on pause. On resume, the next `update()` frame will set them correctly again.
